Data products

Individual Tree Crown (ITC) data was collected by Sarah Graves and Justin Gearhart.
Data in the RSdata folder are derived from NEON-AOP data, collected in 2015 at Ordway Swisher Biological Station. NEON AOP data have been manipulated into the distributed product by the members of the ECODSE group, primarily Sarah Graves and Sergio Marconi. 
Data in the Task2 folder were provided by NEON. Data have been cleaned, subset, and organized to better match the purposes of the competition. All members of the ECODSE group, primarily Sarah Graves and Sergio Marconi, were involved in the preparing the data products.
Data in Task3 folder are derived from combining the NEON-AOP and ITC data, collected at Ordway Swisher Biological Station. NEON AOP data have been manipulated into the provided product by the members of the ECODSE group, and primarily Sarah Graves and Sergio Marconi.
